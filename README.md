# S-Drive-Firmware

    S-drive project is open source BLDC driver for robotics, camera gimbals and more ... 
    Unlike other BLDC drivers on market S-drive is fully integrated solution i.e.
    you dont need any extra encoders, sensors, connectors...

    S-drive project consists of S_drive PCB board and S-drive firmware.
    S-drive firmware is build with soft robotics in mind and ease of use.
    
    S-drive board is based on L6234D BLDC drivers and stm32 microcontroller.
    S-drive PCB is also capable of running other Open source firmwares like:
