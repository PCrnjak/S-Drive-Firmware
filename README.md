# S_Drive---small-BLDC-driver

    S_drive is open source BLDC driver for robotics, camera gimbals and more ... 
    Unlike other BLDC drivers on marked S_drive is fully integrated solution i.e.
    you dont need any extra encoders, sensors, connectors...

    S_drive project consists of S_drive PCB board and S_drive firmware.
    S_drive firmware is build with soft robotics in mind. It is working best with 
    Gimbal BLDC motors and small reduction ratios from 1:4 - 1:10.
